      | This is the home of Material for Meteor (MFM), a
      a(href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank") Meteor
      | package that implements Google's
      a(href="https://material.google.com" target="_blank") Material Design
      | specification using
      a(href="http://blazejs.org" target="_blank") Blaze
      | . Many of the components are adapted from Polymer's interpretation of
      | Material Design. In any cases of conflict, the Material Design
      | specifications are preferred over the
      a(href="https://www.polymer-project.org" target="_blank") Polymer
      | interpretation.
