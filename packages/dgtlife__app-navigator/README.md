# App Navigator
App Navigator manages transitions forward and backward through a set of
UI Screens called the **Navigation Stack**. It is developed specifically for a
responsive web app running in _mobile-web-app-capable_ mode on a mobile device.
In this mode, the web app most closely resembles the native mobile app for which
URLs are _not_ used for navigation control or feedback.

## So What! No URLs? Ever??
OK, don't panic. App Navigator supports URLs when they make sense. Since the web
app is available on the desktop it must respond to URL entry and navigate to the
appropriate Screen. It exhibits this behavior for public URLs only.
